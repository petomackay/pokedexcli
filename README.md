# Pokedex CLI
This project is based on the [Build a Pokedex in Go](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-pokedex-cli-golang) guided project from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev).

It is a simple go CLI app using the [PokeAPI REST API](https://pokeapi.co/):
- to give it a try: `printf "help\nexit\n" | go run .`
